Contributing
============

To get up and running quickly, fork the github repository and make all
your changes in your local clone.

Git-flow is prefered as git workflow, but as long as you make pull requests
against the ``develop`` branch, all should be well. Pull requests should
always have tests, and if relevant, documentation updates.

Feel free to create unfinished pull-requests to get the tests to build
and get work going, someone else might always want to pick up the tests
and/or documentation.


Testing
=======

Django's testcases are used to run the tests.

To run the tests in your (virtual) environment, simple execute

.. code-block:: sh

    python setup.py test

This will run the tests with the current python version and Django version
installed in your virtual environment.

To run the tests on all supported python/Django versions, use tox_.

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install tox
    tox

If you want to speed this up, you can also use detox_. This library will
run as much in parallel as possible.


Documentation
=============

The documentation is built with Sphinx. Run `make` to build the documentation:

.. code-block:: sh

    cd docs/
    make html

You can now open `_build/index.html`.


Coding style
============

Please stick to PEP8, and use pylint or similar tools to check the code style. Also sort your imports, you may use ``isort``
for this. In general, we adhere to Django's coding style.
